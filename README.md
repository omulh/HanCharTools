# Han Character Tools

Han Character Tools is a collection of command scripts and a main wrapper script that help get different information about a Han Character or a list of them.  
From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_characters) article:  
```
Han unification is an effort by the authors of Unicode and the Universal Character Set to map multiple character sets of the Han characters of the so-called CJK languages into a single set of unified characters.
Han characters are a feature shared in common by written Chinese (hanzi), Japanese (kanji), Korean (hanja) and Vietnamese (chữ Hán).
